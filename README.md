# Phonebook App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Phonebook that has search function by first name, last name, and phone number
- Dockerized, has typescript, and functional components
- Checks for duplicate contacts with same names and numbers

## What I learned

- Learned more about React, Docker, and Typescript
- About how to use functional components 

## Things I would improve

- Make it look nicer with more CSS
- Empty the form after an accepted contact
- Only allow certain formats of phone numbers
